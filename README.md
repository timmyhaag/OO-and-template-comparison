# C++ Programming Paradigm Comparison
A comparison is made of two major programming paradigms in C++: OO and templates (generic programming). I will generate two vectors of 1,000,000 random values each and then sort them. The vectors will store objects that wrap other types, in this case ints and strings. Code is written to handle the generation and sorting.
